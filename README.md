# ClickSortForked
ClickSortForked is a Paper plugin forked from ChengZi's ClickSort 1.6.1.

### Description
ClickSort makes it very easy for players to sort their inventories (player/chest/dispenser) with a single or double click of the mouse. 
Players can sort by item ID, item name, switch between single- and double-clicking, or disable sorting entirely, all on a per-player basis and without needing any commands; it's all done with mouse clicks in inventory windows.

ClickSortForked was created because Minecraft 1.20.5, 1.20.6, and 1.21 broke how ChengZi's ClickSort 1.6.1 was handling version control.  
Starting with Minecraft 1.20.5 Java 21 is required. I assume this to be what caused the breaking issue.
